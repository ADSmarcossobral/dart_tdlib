## 0.2.0

Created an even nicer Telegram client that uses streams

## 0.1.2

Used code generation to create all of the classes from the TDLib API documentation.

## 0.1.1

Increased the minimum required Dart SDK version from 2.6.0 to 2.6.0-dev.8.2, as the Dart team
made several breaking changes to `dart:ffi`. Had to increase the `package:ffi` version
accordingly.

## 0.1.0

First version. Creates a `JsonClient` and provides functions for interacting with the Telegram API
directly.
